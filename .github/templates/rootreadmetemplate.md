When Hacktoberfest 2025 launches, you'll be able to contribute by following these steps:

1. Select a project from our upcoming project list that interests you
2. Create a fork of that project's repository (you get a point just by forking!)
3. Create a new branch on your fork
4. Add/Update the repo
5. Submit a pull request!

That's it! More detailed contribution instructions will be available on each project's "CONTRIBUTING.md" file. **Always read a repo's README and CONTRIBUTING files before you participate in a project!**

# <br><a name="projects" href="#projects">![projects](/images/3projects.png)</a>

We will have multiple projects available for participation. To finish your Hacktoberfest goal:  

- You must make four approved pull-requests between October 1 and October 31.  
- These four pull-requests can be spread out across multiple projects or can all be for one project.

## 🚧 Projects Coming Soon! 🚧

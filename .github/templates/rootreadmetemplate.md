- In addition to the above goals, also post a comment on the blog post detailing your contributions.

## 2025 project lineup

### Level 1: Start your open-source, collaborative journey here.

New to open source or Git? Return to our Code Snippets project and contribute without spinning up an instance, perfect for your first pull request. Jump in at [ServiceNowDevProgram/code-snippets](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/code-snippets).

### Level 2: Understand open source in ServiceNow.

Connect a ServiceNow instance to Git and submit records to the Hack4Good Ideation Portal. You'll practice source control inside the platform while fueling future social-impact projects with Hack4Good. Contribute at [ServiceNowDevProgram/Hack4Good-Idea-Submission](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/Hack4Good-Idea-Submission).

### Level 3: Contribute to our cornerstone project.

Help build ActionPack, a utility that the entire ServiceNow community can benefit from. Advanced contributors can shape the roadmap and keep the enhancements flowing. Start building at [ServiceNowDevProgram/ActionPack](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/ActionPack).

## Have a ServiceNow app you want to open to collaboration?

Reach out to Earl Duque, L치szl칩 Balla, or Astrid Sapphire and we'll get your repo officially hosted.

# Contributing to this Repository

Welcome to the ServiceNow Hacktoberfest 2025 community repository! ðŸŽƒ

This is a host repository that orchestrates the Hacktoberfest landing page and coordinates other repositories, so there isn't extensive code to contribute to directly. However, if you have improvements to suggest, we welcome meaningful contributions!

## ðŸ“‹ Contribution Requirements

- **Quality First**: The contribution should not be "spammy" - focus on meaningful improvements
- **No Direct README Edits**: Edits to the root `README.md` file are not allowed and will be automatically overwritten
- **Follow Guidelines**: Ensure your contributions align with the project's goals and maintain professional standards

## ðŸ”„ How the README Works

The root `README.md` file is automatically generated by a combination of GitHub and ServiceNow workflows. Any changes made directly to this file will be immediately overwritten, making such contributions ineffective.

**Instead, contributions should be directed to this file**: [.github/templates/rootreadmetemplate.md](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/Hacktoberfest/blob/main/.github/templates/rootreadmetemplate.md). This template file is used to generate the final README.md.

## ðŸ’¡ What You Can Contribute

- Improvements to the README template (grammar, clarity, helpful additions)
- Enhancements to documentation files
- Updates to contribution guidelines
- Improvements to repository organization and structure
